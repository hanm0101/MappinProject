# MappinProject
Snippets of code that I have worked on from Software Engineering Project (Year 2) 


Project 7: Mappin Data Wrangler
Client: Dominic Rodriguez, Co-Founder and CEO of Mappin Technologies
Team: 8 of Computer Science students

Background: Mappin Technologies has developed a mobile indoor navigation app for students at Guy's Campus. 
All of the internal layout of the buildings is stored in a series of text files which are then copied into the app itself. 
Before this can be done, the data needs to be transformed after collection into the correct coordinate system (one relative to a global campus origin). 
These transformations are infeasible to do manually so a software based solution is required.

Objective: develop an algorithm to automate the transforming the data in the way of scalings, rotations and shifting
The program will need to parse through the data and perform the necessary calculations and alterations, leaving the original format unchanged.  

Type of project: Development of new software for a stand-alone PC. 

Intellectual property arrangements: The copyright of the software is transferred to the client and students retain no access to the source code after completion of the project.  
The students retain the moral rights to be identified as the developers of the application or part of the application and can identify the project and the work they did in the project in their CV, social media pages, job interviews, etc.
